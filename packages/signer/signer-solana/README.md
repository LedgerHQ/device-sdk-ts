### Installation

> **Note:** This module is not standalone; it depends on the [@ledgerhq/device-management-kit](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/device-sdk-ts/tree/develop/packages/core) package, so you need to install it first.

To install the `device-signer-kit-solana` package, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @ledgerhq/device-signer-kit-solana
```
