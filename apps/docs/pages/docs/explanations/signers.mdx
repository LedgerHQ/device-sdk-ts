# Signer Kits

As ledger device are able to install application that will allow to be compatible with different blockchain,
we have created these kits.

Each **signer kit** is coming along with a Ledger Embedded App (ex: _signer-kit-eth_ is comig with _ledger app ethereum_ ).

The main goal of each signer is to ease interaction with the app in the seamlessly possible way.

## Available Signers

- [Signer Ethereum](./signers/eth)
- [Signer Solana](./signers/solana)
