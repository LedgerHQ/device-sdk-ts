# Where can I find the devices USB identifiers?

USB identifiers are essential for applications that need to detect and communicate with Ledger hardware wallets. These identifiers consist of **Vendor ID (VID)** and **Product ID (PID)** pairs that uniquely identify different Ledger device models.

## What are USB identifiers?

USB identifiers are standardized codes used by the USB protocol to identify connected devices:
- **Vendor ID (VID)**: Identifies the manufacturer (Ledger uses `0x2c97`)
- **Product ID (PID)**: Identifies the specific device model within that vendor's product line

## When do you need them?

You'll need these identifiers when:
- Building applications that detect Ledger devices automatically
- Implementing device filtering in transport layers
- Setting up USB permissions for desktop applications
- Configuring device access rules in operating systems

## Available identifiers

The complete list of Devices USB identifiers can be found in the [ledger-live repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/devices/src/index.ts).

This file contains:
- **Device descriptors** for all Ledger hardware wallet models (Nano S, Nano S Plus, Nano X, Flex, Stax, etc.)
- **USB product IDs** for each device variant
- **Device capabilities** and supported communication protocols
- **Bootloader mode identifiers** for firmware update scenarios
