# Introduction

The Device Management Kit (DMK) is a TypeScript library that provides easy communication with Ledger devices:

- Device discovery, identification, and connection
- Device management operations (app installation, device info retrieval) with comprehensive status tracking and error handling
- Ledger OS interaction
- App interaction for cryptographic operations
  - Address derivation, message and transaction signing
- App installation and management
- üîú OS updates

‚ö†Ô∏è
<mark>
** The Device Management Kit is in alpha stage and is subject to significant changes!!!**
</mark>
‚ö†Ô∏è

## How it works

The Device Management Kit features an interface for applications to handle any Ledger device (a.k. hardware wallets). It converts intention into

```mermaid
  flowchart LR;
      application(Application) <--API--> LDMK(LedgerDeviceManagementKit) <--USB/BLE--> device(Device);
```

The Device Management Kit is available in 3 different environments (web, Android & iOS).

This repository contains the **web implementation** of the Device Management Kit, built with TypeScript.

## Structure

### Repository

The Device Management Kit is structured as a monorepository that centralizes all TypeScript code related to the Device Management Kit in one place.

This project uses [turbo monorepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to build and release different packages on NPM registry and a sample demo application on Vercel.

# Getting started

> üí° **The following steps describe only a minimal setup. You will need to perform additional installation steps depending on the package you want to work on, please refer to its nested README file.**

## Environment Setup

### Proto

**proto** is used as the toolchain manager to install the right version of every tool.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Please follow the instructions on the [**proto**](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/proto/install) documentation to install it.

### Dependencies management

**pnpm** is used as the package manager to install all the dependencies.
It is normally provided by **Proto** (see below).

## Installation

1- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LedgerHQ/device-sdk-ts.git
cd device-sdk-ts
```

**Important: All the commands should be run at the root of the monorepo.**

2- Configure using proto

```bash
proto use
```

3- Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

4- Check the shell configuration file

In you shell configuration file (e.g. .bashrc or .zshrc ) verify the path for `proto` is correctly set.
Update it if needed according to the description below.

```bash
# proto
export PROTO_HOME="$HOME/.proto"
export PATH="$PROTO_HOME/shims:$PROTO_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

## Unit Test

**Vitest** is used for unit testing.

Each package is tested using the following command (at the root of the monorepo).

```bash
pnpm <package> test
```

## Build

Each package is built using the following command (at the root of the monorepo).

### Device Management Kit

Device Management Kit main module.

```bash
pnpm dmk build
```

### Signers

Transaction and message signing module.
Each signer is its own package. Here is an exemple with the Ethereum signer:

```bash
pnpm signer-eth build
```

### Trusted Apps

Security dedicated application interface module.
Example with the Ledger Keyring Protocol trusted app:

```bash
pnpm app-keyring build
```

### Sample application

Sample application module.

```bash
pnpm sample build
```

#### Documentation

```bash
pnpm doc build
```

# Processes & usage

## Continuous integration

This project uses Github CI. Please have a look to the following link for more details: [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)

## Scripting

To avoid task repetition, you can add scripts to the corresponding package's script folder, or to a root script folder if they concern multiple packages.
A script is a `.mjs` file interpreted by [zx](https://github.com/google/zx).

## Templates

We use `hygen` to quickly scaffold code and accelerate our development process.
Each project can have its own `_templates` folder, making **generators** scoped to their respective projects.
The `_templates` folder contains the basic generators to create new ones.

[Hygen documentation](https://www.hygen.io/docs/quick-start/)

### Available templates

| workspace | script          | description                           |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| üì¶ dmk    | `module:create` | scaffolds a new _src/internal_ module |

### Process for adding a new generator

The easiest way would be to use `hygen` from the root folder as so:

**Options**:

- `new`: creates a generator that takes no input during creation (but can still access metadata)
- `with-prompt`: creates a generator that can take some input during creation (with access to metadata)

**Important: All the commands should be run at the root of the monorepo.**

```
pnpm hygen generator with-prompt|new name
```

This command will create a new generator folder in the root `_templates` with the given `name`.
It's there so that we can modify this new generator.
When done, move the new generator to it's correct project `_templates` folder (again, so we can keep scope).
Finally, we should add a script in the correct `package.json` as a shortcut to trigger the new generator.
eg:

```
pnpm dmk module:create
```

Under the hood, the script looks like this:

```
pnpm hygen <name> with-prompt
```

- `name` is the name given during the creation of the generator.
- `with-prompt` to call the prompted version of the generator (there can be multiple targets, like `new`)

## Play with the sample app ?

To build the required dependencies and start a dev server for the sample app, please execute the following command at the root of the repository.

```bash
pnpm dev
```
